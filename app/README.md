Title: Vacation Organizer
Purpose: To provide the user with a method of logging details pertaining to vacations such as
associated excursions, as well as offering functionality to perform sharing and notifying features.

Directions:
The app opens on the home screen with a single button. Press the “Enter” button to be directed to a
list of vacations.
It is likely this list is empty! Press the blue action button in the lower right-hand side of the
screen to add your first vacation. You will be directed to the vacation details screen.
On the vacation details screen you can enter details for the name of the vacation and the name of
the place you will be staying. You can select start and end dates for the vacation using the
datepicker. If the datepicker does not display when you click on the date editView, try giving it a
double click. Once all fields are populated, use the drop-down menu in the upper right-hand corner
to save the vacation.
Upon saving a vacation, you will be directed back to the vacation list. You may continue to add
vacations using the blue action button or click on an existing entry to see the vacation details
screen again.
The vacation details screen hosts several functions. Use the drop-down menu in the upper right-hand
corner to save updates to vacation details, delete the vacation, share details using SMS or email,
and generate a notification on the Vacation start and end dates. Also, clicking the blue action
button in the lower right-hand corner will direct the user to the excursion details screen. Let’s
explore excursion functionality next:
When you arrive at the excursion details screen, you can input a name and date for the excursion.
Then, using the menu in the upper right-hand corner, save the excursion. Clicking Save Excursion
will direct you back to the vacation details screen and now, your new excursion will be displayed
under the existing details.
Clicking on your new excursion will take you back to the excursion details screen where you will be
able to update the details, delete the excursion, or generate a notification on the excursion date.
You may notice while navigating the vacation organizer that certain restrictions exist for user
input. For example, a vacation with an associated excursion cannot be deleted. There are date
validations as well to ensure that vacation end dates take place after vacation start dates, and an
excursion date must take place during its associated vacation.
